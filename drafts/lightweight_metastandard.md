Lightweight meta-standard, 2016A\*
=================================

(c) 2016 Daniel Dunn

Introduction
------------

This document outlines a process for creating lightweight semi-informal technical standards and documents.

Format
======

The primary file format should be a github-flavored markdown file, and printing on paper should not be a primary concern in formatting.

Standards should not span more than one file, and should be split up  into smaller standards as needed

The only text directly after the main heading should be license and authorship and other meta-data.

The first second level heading should always be "Introduction" and should contain a summary of the purpose of the standard.

File names should always reflect the title of the standard, and should never be arbitrary number sequences.

Content
-------

Standards should not reference any technology or documentation that is not free to use for any purpose including commercial proprietary software.

Standards may be informal in tone, and may use subjective language.

Version
-------

Titles should include a version identifier which should be in one of the following three formats.

1.  [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) by Tom-Preston Warner. If backwards compatibility is a relevant concept, this is the only acceptable versioning scheme.
2.  The four digit year and, if this is not the first version, a letter starting at 'a' to identify multiple versions within one year, followed by an asterisk for draft version.
3.  The ISO formatted date of release.

Common Usage
------------

Standards should as much as practical adhere to current common practice, and be compatible with as much existing material as possible. Standards should follow the principle of least surprise and maximum compatibility.

To this end, external sources and supporting references should be made for as many elements of the standard as possible, using a hyperlink with sufficient information for a reader to be able to identify the source even if the link is broken.

License
-------

All standards should be licensed under CC0 or CC-BY, but may be copyrighted until finalized.
